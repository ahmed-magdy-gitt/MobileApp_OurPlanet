## 🌌 Project Overview
**Our Planet** is an engaging educational Android application designed to explore the wonders of our Solar System. Built purely with **Kotlin**, the app offers users a visually appealing gallery of planets.

It demonstrates efficient list handling using `RecyclerView` with a `GridLayoutManager`, allowing users to navigate through planets and access rich, localized information (Arabic Content) about each celestial body's distance, temperature, and unique characteristics.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Interactive Grid Gallery
* **Smart Layout:** Utilizes `GridLayoutManager` (2 columns) to display planets in a modern, card-based interface.
* **Responsive Scrolling:** Smooth performance even with high-quality planetary images.

### 📚 Rich Educational Content
* **Detailed Insights:** Dedicated detail screens for each planet (Mercury to Neptune).
* **Scientific Facts:** precise data regarding distance from the Sun, average temperatures, and atmospheric composition.
* **Localized:** Fully supports **Arabic** content, making science accessible to Arabic-speaking users.

### 📱 Architecture & Navigation
* **Data Passing:** Efficient use of `Intent` extras to transfer complex data (Images, Names, Descriptions) between Activities.
* **Clean Code:** Separation of concerns using `PlanetAdapter` and Data Classes (`Planet.kt`).
